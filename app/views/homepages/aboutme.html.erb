	<p class="infotop"> Hi!. My name is <em>Sara</em> and I am happy to give you a glimpse of what I love doing.
		Ever since I was young I had a passion for art and this is the reason I chose Graphic Design as my discipline and oil painting as my hobby. I graduated from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia in 2009 with a Bachelor’s degree in Graphic Design then moved to Toronto in 2014 when I got married. Now here in Toronto, I find myself inspired by the diversity of the country’s ethnic culture and people this encourages me to continue creating my own mixed media artworks and participating at contemporary art shows and traditional markets. My husband, family, culture and country are major inspirations of what I create.</p>

		<p class="infobottom">I combine my artwork and my graphic skills to present various design ideas. I am constantly investigating how to make meaning of different issues by giving them solutions in my own creative way as well as learning how to become better in what I do.</p>
